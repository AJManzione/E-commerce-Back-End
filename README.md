# General Info
- The e-commerce back end application was built to test different routes using insomnia to test these routes, this application was not meant to be deployed but was intended to act as a practice for creating restful routes using express, and mySQL. The video walkthrough can be viewed by clicking the link above and demonstrates how the routes could be interacted with if the application was deployed.
- The application just returns Json information at the moment but with the next application built I will be testing these relationships between express, mySQL and the actual HTML viewed in the browser.
